# About-Me

F: Why do you feel that a dedicated repository is necessary containing these FAQ.
<br>
A: I hope it gives me more stars than the repositories containing my code.

F: Are these FAQ truly "Frequently Asked Questions"?
<br>
A: FAQ means "Frequently Anticipated Quenstions". I don't recall anyone ever asking any.

F: How does a physicist end up doing computer programming?
<br>
A: Physicists understand that everything is just physics. Your question is pointless.

F: What, in your opinion, is the most misunderstood idom in software development?
<br>
A: "Not invented by me!"

F: Looking through your code, it seems you love reinventing the wheel. What is your take on that?
<br>
A: I did invent the wheel!

F: Why do you love software development so much?
<br>
A: I don't really. I love giving commands; but only computers would obey.

F: What do you think could be the best programming language?
<br>
A: A language my wife and kids would interpret correctly.

F: What is the worst Language you were ever compelled to learn?
<br>
A: I can't decide between Latin and SQL.

F: Isn't Latin considered a dead language?
<br>
A: At school I wished it was. But it actually seems to be more alive than SQL.

F: Would you consider mathematics a language of nature?
<br>
A: I consider Mathematics a force of nature.

F: You seem to love developing your own language. Are you good at languages?
<br>
A: I never learned any language well. So, I had to invent my own.

F: Why Xoila? Forgive me, but that name sounds a tiny bit unusual.
<br>
A: Xoila was the shortest name not yet claimed as trademark or company name. It therefore had little competition in Google's ranking.

F: Good thinking, but should a programming language name not also have some descriptive power with respect to its purpose?
<br>
A: Xoila is an asian dish made of chicken, chilly, garlic and ginger. That describes its purpose perfectly! (At least much better than the third letter in the alphabet would.)

F: It seems you dislike using third party code. How come?
<br>
A: I love third party code; it only gives me severe allergic ractions.
